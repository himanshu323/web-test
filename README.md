# Test Automation using Selenium with Java for UI and Rest Assured with Java for API

## Steps to run automated tests

* Download Java JDK 1.8 or higher.
* Setup the environment variable **JAVA_HOME** and configure the same under the **Path** variable
* Download Apache Maven and configure **MAVEN_HOME** environment variable for the same and add it into existing “Path” environment variable 
* Install Eclipse IDE any other IDE of your choice.
* Clone/Download the project and import the  maven project in Eclipse IDE workspace.
* Update the maven project , just to make ensure that maven has downloaded all the necessary dependencies in your local repository from maven central.( `web-test -> Right Click -> Maven -> Update Project`)
* Open command prompt and navigate to project directory, run `mvn clean test` to start the automation execution OR right click on the project in your IDE->Run As->Maven Test.
* Test Run will contain both UI tests and API tests. `Both testngUI.xml and testngAPI.xml files are executed once you run 'mvn clean test'` .
* After the test run finishes, Extent report can be accessed from location **“extentreport/resultsUI.html”**  for UI Tests and **“extentreport/resultsAPI.html”** for API Tests `Overall Test Run will contain 4 Passes in resultsUI.html for UI tests and [3 passes,1 failure] for API tests in resultsAPI.html `. [ Test for Post country is expected to fail since this API doesn't exist yet]


## Features Included in the Framework

* **TestNG** is used as the testing framework/runner
* **Apache POI** is used for reading the data from excel for UI tests `[ src/test/resources/shoppingPortalTestData.xlsx- contains the UI test data]`
* **Maven** is used as the build tool for downloading all the necessary dependencies
* TestNG assertions for verifying the test results
* **Page Factory Model** is used as the design pattern
* Support for `Cross Browser Testing` as well as `Cross-platform`
* Added `Logging` for tests using Extent Report Logger.
* **Extent Report** is used for reporting and also added screenshot capture functionality within extent report in case of failures
* Support for **`Parallel`** testing added w.r.t Shopping Portal UI Tests using ThreadLocal class.

## Note for API Tests automated

Since the Rest API service provided was not working , all countries endpoints were down which were shared within the assignment. Considered another API endpoints which were publicily available and worked on the same functionality to search all countries and get country by alpha code `[ src/test/resources/apiconfig.properties- contains the API test data]`

1.  GetAllCountriesTest- It gets all the countries using `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all`
2.  GetCountryByAlphaCodeTest- It gets all the countries using Alpha2Code
3.  GetCountryByNameWithInvalidData- This test is provided with invalid data to test error **404** response.
4.  PostCountryTest- This API doesn't exist yet as conveyed in the assignment and hence sample request/response shared in assignment was used to build the test case [ this test is expected to fail ].
